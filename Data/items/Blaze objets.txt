Version History
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=
Ver 2.4 (Apr 16 2003)- Changed the format of the section Chest (III).
                      And also add the search function for the easiness
                      in searching the section header. (using ctrl + F)
                      Add more items to part Item Location (II).
                      It may not be accurate. It's from a Japanese
                      FAQ that I translated. I have not try it as the
                      Bosses/enemies dropped it rarely.
                      A trick is also been added to part Tricks (XI).
                      Another added section is the mistranslation part.
                      Parts that are still not complete will be hopefully
                      completed by the next update. Boy lots of work to do!
                      But don't worry, 'cause I enjoy it! It's just the
                      time that is hard to manage.
Ver 2.3 (Feb  7 2003)- Made a lil' correction & addition to some
                      parts. Added new sections :
                      Item Potential (VII) and Cheat Code (XIII).
                      The older sections is placed to another
                      section. Through some adjustments, able to
                      make them neat and organised.
ver 2.2 (Nov  3 2002)- Made some corrections in section V. Add a lot
                      of info in Part IV. And I found many legendary
                      equipments. And added some info in most part.
ver 2.1 (Oct 24 2002)- Just as I realize that the second update has a
                      tremendously terrible format, I change it as quick as
                      possible. In Addition, I add in a little more
                      information.
ver 2.0 (Oct 23 2002)- Added new sections(and change the old section to
                      another section). Edit some of the format. Additional
                      info on most part. Made some corrections. Oh and I
                      made this version history! The sections added are the
                      Elements, Attribute,and Informations.
ver 1.0 (Aug 10 2002)- Created the faq. Made the Introduction (I), Locations
                      of Items(II),Chests(III),Dropped Items(IV), Special
                      Effects(V),Buyable Items(VI),Tricks(VII),

I. Introduction   (ITR)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

As you may know, many items can be found in many places.This faq is a guide
for you to know at least one or two places to get the them. And also what
items lies inside the chests.It is 98% accurate as I fill this faq when I am
playing, but not always ^_^; so there are certain items that I forgot where
I get it. So I hope you all enjoy this faq as much as I enjoy making it.
Furthermore, this faq is not fully completed yet, but I’ll make the update
if I have the time.

As for the update, I apologize very much that it is not organized well. But
the third update should make up for it. Enjoy!

BTW, this FAQ should ONLY be seen in either gamefaqs.com or neoseeker.com

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
II.Item Location  (ILC)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

Hmmmm, without doubt there are many other locations for these items to be
found.But certain items, especially the Legendary Items, can only be found
in that certain places. Like Calvin’s Blade, it took me 20 tries to get
this item. And I’m sure this item can only be found in the Red Dragon’s
lair. Just to make sure you know that a chest can have many items which
you can only get it once in one trip. But some of them only have one,
or maybe two or more.

To make it easier, I put an asterisk sign (*) after the name of the
legendary item, and behind the description of the item if the item is
breakable. And I also avoid items that is bought from the retired knight
if possible, because many of them can be found through exploring dungeons
and ruins or by slaying enemies.

Added(ver 2.4)There are 403 items in all and I have listed all of them
here. 4 of them are still not proved yet though, they are: Dominion
Dagger, Pavas Axe, Gray Arc, and Seraphim Shield.

III.Chests        (CHT)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

There are 2 kinds of chest apart from the ones dropped by enemies & the
purple chest in the inn which is for goods' storage. They are the green
chest which is an ordinary chest, and black chest which is a locked chest.
The key for the some of the locked chests is usually found nearby the
locked chests, like the testing dagger chest, while some others are found
after beating the boss, such as the Red Dragon, the Owl Bear,etc. And
sometimes both the green and the black chests contain key items of that
area.

The factors to determine what you get from the chest could be either using
the character, or just random. Maybe the higher the LUCK, the greater item
you can get. And sometimes chests only have one item, like the one in the
Abandoned Mine, you always get a Round Shield(area near save point of the
3rd under level).

+ You will get Energy Crystal from the southwest chest if you use the trick
 of “Lots of Item”(see section VIII). For example, I have my Katran as the
 Leader,Devonius as the second player, and Velorius as the third player. I
 opened the chest with Devonius and saved that Devonius. So when I reload
 using the same Leader (Katran), Devonius, and other character that will
 open the chest, the chest will still contain item, but will be giving you
 Energy Crystal instead of the weapon. But if the Devonius is not used,
 you will get the weapon instead of the energy crystal.Is it clear? Sorry,
 I can’t find better way to explain...

This section is contributed by James, a huge thanks for this. Without him,
maybe this section will never here. There are 2 chests here. To get to the
room, you need to jump to the second layer in the first screen(press R1 &
R2 for better view). After that, you will notice that there are 6 pillars.
2 in the east, another 2 in the west and another 2 in the north. The ones
you will need to concentrate is the west and the east. The 2 pillars
in the east that you need to notice is the broken one. The wall that you can
go through is just right beside the broken pillar. Do the same thing to
the another. Once again, A big thanks to James!

IV. Dropped Items

Well, after the update, it's no longer far from complete. :) But the items
dropped is exceptional, I wouldn't know if I have got all the items of those
enemies or not. But still, I'm trying my best...

in this section, certain enemies can be found in more than one area(i.e.
Zombies : can be found in the Palace of Immortals & Labyrinth of the Dead).
The term “comp:” means the enemy that can only be found during the boss
fight(helping the boss). But I won’t list the normal enemy that appear with
the boss in “comp:”. Oh yeah, it stands for companion.

If I am not mistaken, the retired knight in the 2nd Floor in the third room
will sell his items after you completed the stage where you have to defeat
the Griffon in the Valley of White Silver, which the place will only appear
after you talk to him after getting several sage stones. The item he sell
may differ, depending on what character that is buying. However, the only
difference is only the glove, both armors, and weapon part.

VI. Item Description (ITD
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

I guess everyone should know this, these descriptions is very incomplete
because I had already throw away the ordinary items as the space of items
that can be kept is very limited. The stock box can only stores up to 12
items per character. And each character can only hold 10 items. Regardless
the items that you can stock until 99, they will only take one space. But I
will try to find them again.

As for the fourth update, this items description is far more complete.

In this part, there are two different things that I interpret it as maybe
the same. When I say MP regeneration + x (varies, depends on the equipment),
it means that the MP regeneration that uses Power will be added by x. So, it
is different from the one that is said like this : " regenerate MP by x",
this means that the MP will be added continuously by x.

Well, I think it will be almost impossible to make this section complete.
But I'll gather as much information as I can.(If only I had think of
doing this section 2 months ago, maybe this section can be completed, at
least for 75% of all the equipments.)

Added(ver 2.4): Well, what can I say? All the items are listed with the
status enhancing attribute. Although it is not 100% correct, and some of
them are still in '??' mark, it is still good to refer to this table.
If you find any mistakes, don't wait and e-mail me straight away. :)
(Phew, at last this section is 95% completed)

X. Tricks         (TRC)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

A) Lots of items.

Here is the most important part if you want to collect more than one item of
one chest in a single trip. It requires you to play at least 2 characters.
The downside of this trick is that you must find a save point of the area
nearby, otherwise, you wouldn't be able to get the items quick. Oh and also,
it needs patient. Because a chest will give you random result of items. But
some chests only have one item,and there are also chests that are programmed
to give items based on the character's job. But don't worry, I already
specified those chests in the part III.Okay,here is the cheat,when you are
adventuring and find a treasure chest or more,don't open them.Instead find a
save point first, then save the leader(the leader is anyone,player 1/2/3/4).
Then get those items with the characters beside the leader. Save everyone
that took the items except the leader. Then start again with the same leader
and take the items with another character. Repeat until you get the item you
want. Simple isn't it? Rather than you repeat the stage all over again just
to get that one item of the chest.

Advantage    : -Get items in the treasure chest faster.
Requirements : -For player that has only one character, you need more space
               for the new one.
              -Need a near save point to the chests in order to be quicker.

B) Appraising without going to the expert (appraiser)

This cheat will only work for the green/black chests, not the chest dropped
by enemies (red). The downside is that you can only appraise the items that
you currently hold. It is very simple. If the chest contains , let's say,
Healing Amulet and you coincidentally hold the same item, the item that lies
in the chest will automatically be appraised. Actually, this trick is no big
deal...

Benefit      : -Only no need to go to the expert.
Requirement  : -Need exactly the same item as the one in the chest.

C) Getting Fate Coins with 100% probability

Actually, the concept of this trick is basically the same with the trick A.
You only need to go to the Old Palace and reach the second floor. Turn all
the switch (A,B,C,D), and have an elf to open the seal and save. Next, open
the chest in the right of the sealed room. if it is not fate coin, load and
repeat until the chest give you Fate Coin but don't take the fate coin yet!
Save first(the leader) then the second player may take it then save. Thus,
load again with the same leader and other player to take the coin. Repeat as
many as you want. The fastest I can score is 5 minutes per Fate Coin
(Including the loading). I used fairy as the leader, casting Quick to
make it faster.

Advantage    : -100% chance of getting Fate Coins.
Disadvantages: -You will definitely get bored.
              -Need an elf if you don't have any.
              -You slay less monsters(only the Green-Slime) rather than
               getting it from Demons/Zombies

D) Getting Holy Armor faster.

I only know to get it from the Platinum-Knights which only appear once. But
there is a way to make them appear more than once without reloading/start a
new stage all over.Here is the trick. When you go to far from the door you
entered, the door will be closed, right? So don't walk too far to make the
door remain open. Then wait until the knights come to you and kill them
except one. Then exit and re-enter. The 3 Platinum-Knights will be there
again, repeat the same method. This is also a good way to stock up Fate
Coins since they drop it quite often even without Dropneal.

Benefits     : -The chance of dropping Fate Coins is second high to Silver
               Gauntlets.
              -Save time
              -Also a good way to train the character until level 165

Added(ver 2.3): You don't need to slay these platinum knights anymore.
Just go to the labyrinth of the undead and go to the 8th underground crypt.
Find a near save point and save. Then go to the secret room which has a
treasure box. If it doesn't give you the holy armor, exit and load again.
see section III for clearer Information.


E) Power (MP regeneration)

You know, your MP will increase in a certain amount of time. Although it
won't if you are chanting (like pressing select & X for magician).But if
you want it to be faster, you can. Just enter a door (that would lead to
another screen),there your MP will increase a bit(depends on your Power)
If you are low on MP, Just go in and out of a door. Maybe you already
know this though....

F) Stop time

Thanks to Rebecca Paliwoda for this great trick. Actually the concept is
very easy. If you are very low on HP, and there are many powerfull enemies
around, and that you have no priest or no more healing items, make use of
your constitution!It is time consuming if you have low constitution (but
the HP regenerating equipments will make up for it). It is either by
pressing the analog button for the Dual Shock joystick or by removing the
port from the PS. That way the enemies and your character will stop. But
your characters will regenerate their HP! Also this trick can also be the
time for your characters' negative effects recovery.

Benefits : -Regenerates HP/MP by using the characters attribute without the
           interference of the enemies.
          -Can wait for the character to heal their negative effects
           without the the enemies' interruption.

G) Duplicate Item - Thanks to James for this

Enter an auction and sell armors or weapons in one of your characters, then
the one who bought the armor/weapon(buyer) will save,don't save the one who
sells the armor/weapon. Reset and load the game.
Note: The armor/weapon must be unequipped.(Again, thanks to James for this)

To tell you further, you can duplicate all kinds of equipment(not just
weapon & armor). Too bad you can't duplicate objects (eg. Healing
Potions, and most importantly, Fate Coins).

Ummmm, some of the tricks are already explained by me in the message board,
but had already been deleted. So I'll just write it here for the tricks to
be permanent.

H) Shortcut in the Valley of White Silver

You know, the only way to get the Perseus Bow is only by fighting Griffon,
the boss of the Valley of White Silver. Since the road to the Griffon Nest
is a bit long, I found a shortcut! When in the very first screen, you can
actually jump to the top by using a little help from the arising ground
nearby the trees. There are actually two trees that can be used, which
both are the nearest.

I) Easiness in fighting Doppleganger - Thanks to ...(sorry forgot whom)

Before fighting Doppleganger, unequip yourselves so that the AI will
have disadvantages over equipments.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
This section is all thanks to James, who have have helped me a lot!
These are the contribution that I forgot to put. Sorry!

- Fast boat speed
If you're playing with another player, press their analog button or
unplug the controller.

- Cancel the effect of magic
When your character has a poison, paralysis (etc...) status, Cast a
certain spell (priest) that can cure the status effect. While it
animates, go thru a door, you will see the ailment/status is still
there. (Who wants to do that?!?!)

- Reverse-Magic
When your enemy makes your def/atk down, cast a certain spell that
makes it increase like 'striking', you will see that the effect is
neutralized.

- Effect of Materials
When you use a material, for example fire, and it gives you
additional 3, and you used next is water, which gives you 2. Your
fire will decrease the amount of water you add. (you know that, the
opposing elements)

- Avoiding 'Drain'
Simply Run! :) (I know! you know that!)

- Keeping your Luck safe
no matter what happens, don't try to get hit, fall and anything else
that could make damage or status. When you level-up, you'll have the
chance of increasing your luck. (I don't know if thats the point,
e-mail me if that did'nt work for you)

XI. Tips/Informations (TPI)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

This section is the informations I found. The informations here are believed
to be not common. I added this section so that the informations won't mix
with the tricks section.

A) Constitution (HP regeneration)

This is an information on how to make use of Constitution (Restoring HP). In
order to use it, you must stay put for about 10 seconds. Don’t even walk or
chant spell. Attacking is also prevent the HP to increase. From there, your
HP will start to increase depending on your Constitution.

B) Invunerable to magic

There are some equipments that make you block magics, even the healing
magics. To make your chance of blocking magic higher, for warrior & dwarf,
equip them with Mirror Armor, Reflective Shield, and Reflector Ring. For
sorcerer, priest, & fairy, equip them with Shadow Robe and Reflector Ring.
And for elf, rogue & hunter, equip them with Reflector (armor) & Reflector
Ring.

Advantage    : -Magic attacks seldom hit you
Disadvantages: -Healing or any other support magics are also blocked, but
               just unequip them to counter it.And FYI,when you are dead
               and your priest want to revive the dead character, he/she
               will find a hard time reviving the dead character even if
               the dead character has been unequipped.

Added (ver 2.4). There is an equipment called Solomon's Ring which
deflects any kind of magics with 100% probability. So, just head for
this clothing rather than equipping the anti-magic equipments. BTW,
the Solomon's Ring is gotten from the Gigantes, one of the final 5
bosses.

C) Reincarnation

just an information about the reincarnation spell. This spell is not only
for reviving dead allies, but also restores the HP back to full. So this
spell is not completely useless if you are playing by yourself. But using
Restore magic is better since it uses less MP and the time used for the
motion is not as much as the Reincarnation spell.

Advantages    : Unless too revive an ally, this spell is only better at the
               animation.(The animation is not so cool either ^_^;)
Disadvantage  : Using this spell to yourself takes a long motion, the enemy
               might kill you first before the spell heals you.

D) Poison/Petrify

I think these are the most dangerous status effects. Petrify reduce your HP
as well as make you unable to move while poison only reduce your HP. Be
aware that both status effects eliminate the ability for HP regeneration.
I mean the HP regeneration used from constitution, not the one using
equipment. So the Stop Time trick in the section above will give you no
benefits except for the status effect recovery time. And if they are
combined, you'll be dead if your HP is less than 3/4(if there is no one to
heal you).

Added(ver 2.4): Actually, just to correct that if both the status effects
are combined, it would definitely kill you even if you have an absolutely
high HP with full current HP. Because they decrease your HP by percentage.
So, you have to have another player which can cure you. But just ignore
this correction as petrification and poison will not get you at once
(enemies rarely cause status effects). A thing to notice is that Poison
status effect is very dangerous because it take more than 3/4 of your
max HP.

E) Mistranslation / Name Transformation

I got some mistranslations from the japanese version,but not to say like
that. Some items are not mistranslated, but given a new name. (you know,
it's common)
It's actually like this: They translated Sol Guard as Sun Shield, Sol Sword
as Sunblade. But they didn't tell Sol Crown as Sun Crown...so far I only
got these.

Basirisk                                                Basilisk

F) Luck Factor

Hey, I got an interesting info! I got one of the uses of Luck! It also
determines the critical attack ratio... I got it from one of the Japanese
Blaze & Blade web pages...

The max pure Luck is 200,so using fate coin or through leveling you can't
pass 200. Except if you are using a Luck enhancing equipment (i.e. Jewel
Ring, Luck Talisman, Lucky Earrings, Dragon Scales, etc)

LUK   0 -  31, Critical Attack = 1% + (equipment critical ratio)
LUK  32 -  63, Critical Attack = 2% + (equipment critical ratio)
LUK  64 -  95, Critical Attack = 3% + (equipment critical ratio)
LUK  96 - 127, Critical Attack = 4% + (equipment critical ratio)
LUK 128 - 159, Critical Attack = 5% + (equipment critical ratio)
LUK 160 - 191, Critical Attack = 6% + (equipment critical ratio)
LUK 192 - 200, Critical Attack = 7% + (equipment critical ratio)

As for the class Hunter & Rogue, the critical attack + 1% bonus

And again, thanks to James for telling me this:
The Luck won't affect the determination of the dropping of items.
It may, but not high. James' Elf with the Luck of 3 still got
items.

I read it somewhere (forgotten) that the Luck also takes part in Items.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                              |              Affection                |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                              |   Luck    | Level    | Monster Beaten |

Resistance of Traps                 high      high         ??
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

G) At, Df, Mat, and Mdf.

Again, I got it from the same site as for the Luck Factor. It is only
to know how to calculate the growth.

Attack Power
------------
At  = (level XXXX/4) + (Str XXX/ 4) + (equipment AT)

Defense Power
-------------
Df  = (level XXXX/4) + (Agl XXX/16) + (Con XXX/13) + (equipment DF)

Magical Attack Power
--------------------
Mat = (level XXXX/4) + (Pow XXX/ 4) + (equipment MAT)

Magical Defense power
---------------------
Mdf = (level XXXX/4) + (Int XXX/13) + (Wil XXX/16) + (equipment MDF)

For attack power, it is best to be added to the character that make use
of physical attack alot. For example, Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, and
Dwarves. For elves, You may want to make a well balanced attack for both
physical attack and magical attack.

To me, what you should raise for each character is:

Warrior - ....
Rogue   - ....
Dwarf   - ....
Hunter  - Agility (For the potential of healing using herbs)
Priest  - Will Power (For the potential of healing magic)
Sorcerer- Power (For great magical attack power)
Elf     - ....
Fairy   - ....

In most RPG games:
-A warrior should have high physical offense. (Str)
-A dwarf should high physical defense.        (Con)
-A priest should have more magical endurance. (Wil)
-A sorcerer should be smart.                  (Int)
-An elf can cast great magic.                 (Pow)
-A rogue should be agile.                     (Agi)
-An archer should be agile.                   (Agi)
-A fairy should be lucky.                     (Luk)

H) Blood Extract (not a trick) - This is contributed by James

If you picked these items, use it! it will increase your HP to max.
But the downside is, when you fall, damage is greater. (falling,
stepping in a trap etc.) I think there's a percentage of damage you
will get. for example, you falled in a pit, let's say you receive 5%
damage of your HP. Got the Point? The higher your life, the more
damage you will take. I'm currently receiving 100+ damage every trap!

XIII. Cheat Code  (CHC)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

A new section for sharker!These codes are tested with Action Replay ver 1.4
Although this is only a few codes, but it is quite useful!

                    1234
                    ||||
Max      HP 800F0148 270F
Infinite HP 800F014C 270F

Max      MP 800F014A 270F
Infinite MP 800F014E 270F

-------------------------

Max Str 800F0280 03E7
Max Int 800F0282 03E7
Max Wil 800F0284 03E7
Max Agi 800F0286 03E7
Max Con 800F0288 03E7
Max Pow 800F028A 03E7
Max Luk 800F028C 03E7

Now, for the non-sharker:

All the 4 digits in the right are represented in Hexadecimal, so you can
adjust it to get the desired amount.

The formula is:
(X1 * 4096) + (X2 * 256) + (X3 * 16) + (X4 *1)

Number:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15
        ----------------------------------------------------
Hex   :  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9   A   B   C   D   E   F

here: X1 is the 1st digit while the X2 is the second digit and so on.
so 03E7 is   (0 * 4096) + (3 * 256) + (E * 16) + (7 * 1)
          =    0       +   768     +   224    +    7
          =   999

and 270F is  (2 * 4096) + (7 * 256) + (0 * 16) + (F * 1)
          =  8192      +  1792     +    0     +    15
          =  9999

Change the 4 digits to your liking...
enjoy!!

XIV. Asked Questions (ASQ)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+

1. How do I use the spell commands?

-  Just hold 'Select' button while executing the command

2. How do I get the western chest(both northwest&southwest)in the Clearing?
  I obviously have hunter in my party. but the only path he can pick up on
  the west side is the path linking a top and bottom entrance on the west
  side. Is there a path leading off from this?

-  No, there is no path leading off from there. Actually, the west side has
  4 paths.The two path you used is just to confuse you.

3. Is there anything special about Jewel Box?

-  According to someone(forgot whom), It increases the chance of enemy
  dropping Items. But when I try it,I can't find the difference,or should
  I say, it didn't work. James also told me that it didn't increase the
  percentage. But it multiplies the amount of money you get from enemies.

4. Can I get Hidden Spell by levelling?

-  No, you MUST read it, and of course you must have enough Intelligent to
  learn it. The requirements are as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Job      Spell Name             Place                Requirement
==========================================================================
  Priest : Reincarnation        * Ruins in the Lake  * Int 190 (or above)
           Call/Summon Angel    * The Old Palace     * Int 210 (or above)
  Wizard : Chaos Rage/Flare     * Lab. of the Undead * Int 240 (or above)
           Meteor Storm/Smash   * The Old Palace     * Int 220 (or above)
           Fusion               * The Roadside Inn   * Int 210 (or above)
  Fairie : Elemental Control(4) * The Desert Valley  * Int 160 (or above)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What for is Pandora's Box? It seems to decrease my characters' HP to 1.

-  Well, your HP decreases, but the enemies' HP are also decreased.

6. Is there any cheat codes that allows you to be quick in Levelling?

-  Yes, the cheat is:
  80053F3A 00FF
  800F0158 00FF (change 00FF to 0FFF on both codes for more efficient use)
  (Taken from the Gamefaqs' Code & Secret section posted by Leo)
  Although it said for japanese version, it works for the English version
  too!
 *In order to load the character's data with the cheat code, you must
  switch off the Action Replay while you load the characters' data. Then
  switch it on when you finished loading the characters' data.

7. where can i get the penultimate magic of sorcerer? i already have chaos
  flare and fusion.

- The spell is located in the secret room along with the priest's forbidden
 spell. After defeating the dark wizard, jump north through the wall. The
 path there should lead you to the secret room.

8. What's the difference between Energy Flask and Energy Crystal?

- The difference is just the animation and that Energy Flask can only be
 used when one party member is suffering from 'Drain', unlike the Energy
 Crystal, which cast Priest Spell 'Recover Energy' whether the character
 casted upon is ill from 'Drain' or not. Oh and their destruction rate
 is also different.

9. What for is Barrier & Magic Barrier of priest spell?It didn't increase
  the Defense and Magic Defense!

- They both are not used to stimulate statistic even for a while. The
 Barrier is to repel enemies to go near you (must hold the X button)
 while the Magic Barrier (Resist Field) is to block blockable magic.
 Blockable    : Blaze, Blizzard, Poison Cloud, Meteor Storm, etc
 Non-blockable: Lightningbolt, Thunderbolt, Chaos Rage, etc

XV. Credits        (CRD)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

I would like to say thanks to the Fun Soft for publishing the english
version and also the people in the message board for talking in it,
giving me the courage to play it still.
Added(ver 2.4):
Especially the ones who still talks there, especially LethalBahamut,
CloudvsSephiroth, Master GuanYu, TrueKyoKusanagi, and many more.

Thanks also goes to my brother,
Wandy who lend me his PS(should've said that in the first creation of
this FAQ).And also, thanks a lot to all the people who gave their
informations to me, namely (in no particular order):


- Rebecca Paliwoda <becky@intvis.co.uk>
- James <cacay.arnisto@eudoramail.com>
- Theng Deqiang <kluvm@hotmail.com>


Without them, I might find difficulty in making this FAQ more complete.
Oh, and great thanks to CJayC for posting this FAQ (should've said this
earlier ^_^;).

Not to forget you, who read this FAQ. Without anyone reading this FAQ,
the time and effort I spent will be in vain...

Added(ver 2.4): I think my credit section for James is still not
enough. I don't know how to thank or how to apologize('cause many of
his contribution is not posted here). It is so because that time I was
really busy. But don't worry, I didn't delete the e-mails, so I can
refer to those and put it here.

*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*
XVI.  Last words  (LWD)
*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*+*

Now, if there is any questions regarding Blaze & Blade, just ask,maybe i can
answer. And do NOT forget to type "Blaze & Blade" as the subject title.
Informations regarding this game will be greatly appreciated. As this is the
second update, 2 sections are added. It requires a lot of patience and time.
So, I hope you all enjoy this!

Wee, forgot to update this part for the 3rd update. Anyways, the fourth
update, there are many things I discovered. Especially for the dropped item
section. I guarantee that it's 80% complete!

Now, for the 5th update, it is a dissapointment because the data that is
supposed to be better is lost (the laptop I am using had a bad sector in the
Hard Drive,therefore the data is suddenly gone before I was able to make the
backup). But, the only lost is that you have to wait longer...

The ver 2.4 should improve the Item Location a little. They are added with
the word 'rumored'. It's because I haven't got it yet, therefore I won't
confirm it. So, It will only be added in the Part II(Item Location, Part
VIII (Special Effects), Part IX (Element), and Part X (Attribute).
Of course the information in those parts are still vague (haven't checked
yet). Because of the uncertainty, I won't add it to the Part IV (Dropped
Items). In this update, I also changed the Part III(Chests). It is so
because CloudVsSepiroth said he doesn't like the format (I'm just
guessing that the format he doesn't like is in Part III).
